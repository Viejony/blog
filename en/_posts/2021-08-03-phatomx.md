*phantomx_pincher* is a *ROS* software package, that allows to simulate a robot arm, the *PhantomX Pincher*, in the *Gazebo* simulation environment.

In this post I'll show the development, the used tools and the results of this project.

## The robot

The *phantomx_pincher* is a manipulator robot arm with 4 DOF (*Degrees of Freedom*). It's a low cost robot with *Dynamixel* servomotors, used in the academics for the study of manipulator arms.

The 3D files used in this project are hosted in *GrabCAD*: next picture shows the real robot photo and a render image of the 3D files.

## URDF model

From the 3D files, the joints subsets are defined. Then, *DAE* files are generated as independent parts. For this robot, four subsets are defined:
- *Shoulder*: contains the control electronics and the first servomotor.
- *UpperArm*: the second servomotor that links with *Shoulder* and *Lowerarm*
- *LowerArm*
- *Wrist*: contains the *Fingers* actuator
- *Fingers*: the end of the manipulator, made up with two parts that moves linearly.

Every set is converted to a 3D file among a simplified version used as solid body for collisions. Using these 3D files, an *URDF* model is builded. An *URDF* is a file that uses *XML* syntax to define every component. In this model, every joint between any pair of links is defined together with the inertial properties of the real robot.

The *URDF* model is used in *RViz* and *Gazebo* applications for both, visualization and simulation with realistic physics.

## RViz: joints visualization

*RViz* is a software for visualization of *ROS* topics, used as a geneal purpose *GUI* for different robots. For this project, *RViz* is used as a *URDF* robot model viewer. The next picture shows the visual model of the robot (left) and the collision model of the same robot (right). Note that the collision model has simpler geometries, but the visual model has a more detailed and realistic geometry.

*RViz* allows to manipulate the robot model, moving the joints that was defined for this robot, through a simple windows with sliders. The below picture shows this *GUI* and the *PhantomX Pincher* in a custom pose.

## Gazebo: simulation with realistic physics

*Gazebo* is a robot simulation framework with realistic environments that also works with *ROS*. *Gazebo* uses the physics properties of the environment to simulate the real behavior of the arm. The next picture shows el robot model in *Gazebo* with the center of mass of every set. The showed pose corresponds to *home* robot pose: *Gazebo* simulates the *Dynamixel* actuators and every servomotor controller and puts the required torque to preserve arm in extended pose.

The collision model is used by *Gazebo* to determinate in which points the solid bodies collides with another body. This allows to the robot interact with closer parts, achieving a correct simulation of *pick and place* task or realistic hits with the ground (of course, we don't want that to robot hits anything).

With *Gazebo* an scene with load and unload zones drawn in the ground was created. Small and lightweight pieces that can be grasped byt the robot arm were added. The next picture shows a part of the scene.

## GUI in *MATLAB*

*MATLAB* is used to build a *GUI* *(Graphical User Interface)* that allows to use the robot, using predefined positions, load zones, unload zones and small parts created for *Gazebo*. *MATLAB* includes a plugin to link with *ROS*, for which the inverse kinematics can be resolved in *MATLAB* side and publish through *ROS* messages to the robot.

The *GUI* allows to visualize the robot pose, the joint values, set a operation mode (manual or automatic) and shows the streamed image of a virtual camera mounted in *Gazebo*. The next picture shows the *GUI* appearance.

## Teleoperation experiment with *ROS*, *AWS* and *Gazebo*

The last objective of this project is to do a remote operation task with the simulated robot in *Gazebo*, sending commands from a remote PC. A *VPN* network is mounted, taking advantage of free services of *AWS (Amazon Web Services)*. With this network, to PC are linked, one of them running the simulation and another running the *MATLAB GUI*. Although there are delays in the communication because the packages needs to pass first in the *VPN* node, teleoperation and visualization are possible with these solutions. To see a demo, see the *Sample Videos* section.

## Sample videos

The next video shows a simple exercise with the *PhantomX Pincher* simulated in *Gazebo*. *Pick and place* tasks are made, sending commands to thr robot with a simple *GUI*.

The video below shows the *Remote control of a PhantomX Pincher robot using Gazebo and MATLAB* project. Simulation runs in a remote PC, meanwhile the control and visualization *GUI* runs in a local PC. Connection between the PCs is made through a *VPN*, using *AWS*.
